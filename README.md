# NextTrip Case Study

## Getting Started
Submit a working web application that displays Minneapolis Metro Transit bus line information based on
APIs available via Metro Transit NextTrip API. You may use any web frameworks or libraries that you'd
like to complete this project. Build a web application that provides functionality similar to the one found
at https://www.metrotransit.org/nextripbadge.aspx. The application must provide the following
functionality:

* Select a bus route from a list of available routes
* Select a direction for a bus route
* For a given route and direction, display the stops
* Respond reasonably to browser back and forward buttons (for example, implement application
routing)
* Include test code that validates your application works as expected. Include a README.md file
that includes:
  * The steps to build and run your application.
  * The steps to execute provided tests.
  * A list of assumptions you made during development.

* To submit your application, you may either email a zip archive of your project or provide remote
access to your project repository.
